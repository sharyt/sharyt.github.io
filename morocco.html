                <p id ="morocco-intro"><span style="font-size:38px"><b>I had the pleasure</b></span> of visiting Marrakech, Morocco in April 2014. 
                It was there where I had my first introduction to North Africa, and needless to say, it made a lasting impression. 
                From a more scholastic standpoint, it was incredibly fascinating to learn about Morocco and its relationship with Europe, and its African 
                neighbors, in addition to experiencing the vast cultural differences between being in the city center versus up in the mountains. 
                And from a personal standpoint, I learned quite a few things as well, like: how to ride a camel, that oranges taste better in Morocco, 
                try not get scammed by Henna people in tourist traps, and never to forget your only pair of sneakers in a foreign hostel. 
                I never did quite figure out why there were so many stray cats though. <b>Images include: Koutoubia Mosque, Palmeraie, Jardin Majorelle, & the Ourika Valley.</b>
